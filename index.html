              On October 3, Adobe revealed that it had been the victim of an
              attack that exposed Adobe customer IDs and encrypted passwords. At
              the time, the company said that hackers gained access to encrypted
              credit card records and login information for around 3 million
              users. But the number of affected accounts has turned out to be
              much higher. The attack actually involved 38 million active
              accounts.

              On November 24, 2014, a hacker group which identified itself by
              the name "Guardians of Peace" leaked a release of confidential
              data from the film studio Sony Pictures. The data included
              personal information about Sony Pictures employees and their
              families, e-mails between employees, information about executive
              salaries at the company, copies of then-unreleased Sony films,
              plans for future Sony films, scripts for certain films, and other
              information. The perpetrators then employed a variant of the
              Shamoon wiper malware to erase Sony's computer infrastructure.

              During the hack, the group demanded that Sony withdraw its
              then-upcoming film The Interview, a comedy about a plot to
              assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, and threatened
              terrorist attacks at cinemas screening the film. After many major
              U.S. cinema chains opted not to screen The Interview in response
              to these threats, Sony elected to cancel the film's formal
              premiere and mainstream release, opting to skip directly to a
              downloadable digital release followed by a limited theatrical
              release the next day.

              On 20 March 2013, three South Korean television stations and a
              bank suffered from frozen computer terminals in a suspected act of
              cyberwarfare. ATMs and mobile payments were also affected. The
              South Korean communications watchdog, the Korea Communications
              Commission, raised their alert level on cyber-attacks to three on
              a scale of five. North Korea has been blamed for similar attacks
              in 2009 and 2011 and was suspected of launching this attack as
              well. This attack also came at a period of elevated tensions
              between the two Koreas, following Pyongyang’s nuclear test on 12
              February. South Korean officials linked the incident to a Chinese
              IP address, which increased suspicion of North Korea as
              "intelligence experts believe that North Korea routinely uses
              Chinese computer addresses to hide its cyber-attacks."

            <p>
              The attacks on all six organizations derived from one single
              entity. The networks were attacked by malicious codes, rather than
              distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks as suspected at the
              beginning. It appeared to have used only hard drive overwrites.
              This cyberattack “damaged 32,000 computers and servers of media
              and financial companies.” The Financial Services Commission of
              South Korea said that Shinhan Bank reported that its Internet
              banking servers had been temporarily blocked and that Jeju Bank
              [ko] and NongHyup reported that operations at some of their
              branches had been paralyzed after computers were infected with
              viruses and their files erased. Woori Bank reported a hacking
              attack, but said it had suffered no damage. Computer shutdowns
              also hit companies including the Korean Broadcasting System,
              Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation, and YTN.

              While multiple attacks were organized by multiple perpetrators,
              one of the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against
              the South Korean government websites were directly linked to the
              “DarkSeoul” gang and Trojan.Castov. Malware related to the attack
              is called "DarkSeoul" in the computer world and was first
              identified in 2012. It has contributed to multiple previous
              high-profile attacks against South Korea. This hacking further
              speculated that North Korea was responsible for the attacks. It
              was told by investigators that “an IP address used in the attack
              matched one used in previous hacking attempts by Pyongyang.” Park
              Jae-moon, a former director-general at the Ministry of Science,
              ICT and Future Planning said, “82 malignant codes [collected from
              the damaged devices] and internet addresses used for the attack,
              as well as the North Korea's previous hacking patterns," proved
              that "the hacking methods were the same" as those used in the 20
              March cyber attacks.

            <p>
              The Internet service company Yahoo! reported two major data
              breaches of user account data to hackers during the second half of
              2016. The first announced breach, reported in September 2016, had
              occurred sometime in late 2014, and affected over 500 million
              Yahoo! user accounts. A separate data breach, occurring earlier
              around August 2013, was reported in December 2016. Initially
              believed to have affected over 1 billion user accounts, Yahoo!
              later affirmed in October 2017 that all 3 billion of its user
              accounts were impacted. Both breaches are considered the largest
              discovered in the history of the Internet. Specific details of
              material taken include names, email addresses, telephone numbers,
              encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers, dates of
              birth, and hashed passwords. Further, Yahoo! reported that the
              late 2014 breach likely used manufactured web cookies to falsify
              login credentials, allowing hackers to gain access to any account
              without a password. Yahoo! has been criticized for their late
              disclosure of the breaches and their security measures, and is
              currently facing several lawsuits as well as investigation by
              members of the United States Congress. The breaches have impacted
              Verizon Communications's July 2016 plans to acquire Yahoo! for
              about $4.8 billion, which resulted in a decrease of $350 million
              in the final price on the deal closed in June 2017.
